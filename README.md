## Goal
Get the hero to the flag at the end of the level, while avoiding the enemies. Each enemy does 1 damage to you be careful of the spikes! Collect coins along the way to help give your hero more health. Every 10 coins gives you an extra heart and resets you to 0 coins. Coins and goals will give you score in your game. Try to beat your high score each time you play!

## How To Play
Use the WAD keys to move. D moves your hero right. A moves your hero left. W moves your hero up or makes the hero jump.

## Levels
There are 5 levels in total for my game. Each level will get progressively harder the more levels you complete with level 1 being the easiest and level 5 being the hardest. Each level has a different theme and different block style, as well as different types of enemies for that level.
